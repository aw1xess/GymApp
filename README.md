Hello, my name is Yaroslav and I'm creating an application for people, who go to gym to help them tracking their progress, especially taking notes of their exercises, amount of reps and weight. I'm using React for frontend, MongoDB for database and MongoDB Realm HTTP Endpoints for interaction with database.
